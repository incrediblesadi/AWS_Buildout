# Full Rollout Connection Plan

## Objective:
- Establish a complete system where CustomGPT — AppSync (GraphQLL) — — Lex — — S3 (Memory) — — Lambda — — DynamoDBB.
- Introduce session memory storage in S3.
- Enable Lex to determine intent before calling Lambda.

## Steps:
1. "Expand AppSync API Schema"
  - Add queries/mutations for Lex and S3.
2. "Establish Lex Integration"
  - AppSync routes GraphQLL api calls to Lex.
  - Lex analyzes intent before deciding next steps.
3. "Set Up S3 for Session Storage"
  - One bucket for JSON (structured memory logs).
  - One bucket for unstructured data (user logs, backups).
4. "Modify Lambda to Work with Lex & S3"
  - If Lex finds intent, process normally.
  - If Lex fails, Lambda handles execution.
5. "Enhance DynamoDB for Storing Lex & Lambda Actions"
  - Create multiple tables for Lex and Lambda actions.
